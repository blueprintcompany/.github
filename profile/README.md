# Blueprint Software

Custom software engineered around real workflows.  
We build tools that fit your team, not the other way around.

## What We Do

Blueprint Software specializes in:

- Custom web applications (internal tools, dashboards, portals)
- Systems integrations that eliminate manual re-entry across platforms
- Automation & AI assistants tailored to your data and rules 
- APIs & cloud services designed for maintainability and scale 
- Responsive, mobile-friendly interfaces across devices

We help teams stuck in spreadsheets, siloed tools, or manual workflows build reliable systems that work for them.

## Engineering & Process

**Approach**

1. Understand your workflow — deep dive into tools, pain points, and requirements.
2. Iterate fast — prototypes, demos, and feedback loops shorten the path to working software.
3. Launch & improve — phased launches with support and refinement after real usage.

**Principles**

- Clarity in requirements, design, and code  
- Focused solutions, not over-engineered features  
- Testable, maintainable, and documented systems

## Open Source

Blueprint Software believes in open source software because we would not be where we are today without it. We publish tools, libraries, and utilities that:

- Reduce duplication and boilerplate
- Support workflow-centric automation
- Improve developer productivity

Notable contributions so far:

We also contribute back to frameworks and utilities that make our lives easier in order to thank the contributors, show our support, and uplift all developers, including:

- [.NET](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet)
- [Skwasjer.MockHttp](https://github.com/skwasjer/MockHttp)
- [TUnit](https://github.com/thomhurst/TUnit)
- [Soenneker.AutoBogus](https://github.com/soenneker/soenneker.utils.autobogus)
